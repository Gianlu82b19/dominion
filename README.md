# Dominion
Multi component workflow that can interconnect APIs
# Purpose
Dominion is a Block-based workflow that can be configurated and work as a deployable stand-alone workflow
# Blocks
Blocks are basic software pieces that can perform these three step:
- Get a Data
- Elaborate a Data
- Send Data to other block

Each Block is independent and don't understand or know the reason why other Block should exists. Each Block exists to perform its own micro-activity.
Every Block can be connected to other passing data as a Json object
